# Machine Learning fundamentals

This repository contains a structured collection of machine learning experiments implemented in Python. The notebooks were originally developed incrementally in Google Colab and later organized here for clarity, reproducibility, and reuse. The focus of this repository is to build intuition around core machine learning concepts through hands-on experimentation rather than polished production systems.

    supervised/ # Regression and classification algorithms
    unsupervised/ # Clustering and dimensionality reduction
    preprocessing/ # Data cleaning, scaling, outlier detection, handling imbalanced data

Notes:
python codes or notebooks are organized by topic rather than as a single end-to-end project.
Each code/notebook includes brief explanations and observations to document learning.
This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and reference.
